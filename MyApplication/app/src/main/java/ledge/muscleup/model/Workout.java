/**
 * Workout
 * This class is used to store information about workouts.
 * They contain exercises, a list of required equipment, muscle groups worked, sets/reps or duration
 * for each exercise and a workout type, maybe.  Considering the
 * goals for this class there is currently no simple way to associate exercises
 * with any sort of duration. Of course, duration for an exercise is specific to a workout so
 * this is a problem we'll have to solve, sooner rather than later.
 *
 * This is all future iteration stuff and is subject to change.
